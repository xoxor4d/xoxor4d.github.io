	Site Migration - Incomplete
</div>
I didn't feel like paying for weebly any longer, so I switched to github-pages as it's more then enough for my use-case.
__[Bouncepatch.com](https://bouncepatch.com)__ will redirect any requests to this site for the next year or so. This site will be frequently updated with tools / research / tutorials or whatever else I feel like is worth posting.

Oh, hey there! You might be asking yourself what this site is about and what kind of content can found here.   
This is something like a blog / wiki, featuring research, tools and projects surrounding the Call of Duty Games.  

<div class="padding-2l"></div>

Most of you might know me as the creator of the "__Bounce-Depatcher__" or "__Custom-HLSL-Shaders__" for CoD4.  
If you want to know more about me and what I do, make sure to check out the __[[About]](/about)__ section.

<div class="padding-2l"></div>

Make sure to visit the __[[Research]](/research)__ section if you are interested in common glitches found in Call of Duty Games. ( eg. _Bouncing / Elevators_ )  
Visit the __[[Projects]](/projects)__ section for a collection of released tools or projects that I'm working on. ( eg. _Multi Call of Duty - Bounce Depatch Tool_ )  
If you are searching for a few niche-tutorials, like HLSL-Shaders in CoD4, make sure to visit the __[[Tutorials]](/tutorials)__ section.
